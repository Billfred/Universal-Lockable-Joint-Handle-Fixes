# Universal-Lockable-Joint

# Overview

This is a low-cost 3D printable joint to be used in mounting assistive technology. The joint allows for 1/2 inch PVC pipes to be inserted in and allow movement in all degrees of freedom. This device is intended to work with other PAMS mounting devices to allow adjustable and lockable positioning in all directions.

# Usage

Once the PVC is placed into the lockable joint and then positioned in the desired location. Once the optimal mounting location is found the joint can be locked in place by turning the handle of the device. This locks all the directions of the device. This can be repositioned by simply loosening the handle and tightening once again.

There is an optional larger handle that can be 3D printed as well. This version is better for individuals with reduced grip strength and allows more area to grab onto. If you are requesting this device and want to try out the larger handle please include that in the details of the request.
