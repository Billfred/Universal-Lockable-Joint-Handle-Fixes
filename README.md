# Universal-Lockable-Joint

# Overview

This is a low-cost 3D printable joint to be used in mounting assistive technology. The joint allows for 1/2 inch PVC pipes to be inserted in and allow movement in all degrees of freedom. This device is intended to work with other PAMS mounting devices to allow adjustable and lockable positioning in all directions.

Once the PVC is placed into the lockable joint and then positioned in the desired location. Once the optimal mounting location is found the joint can be locked in place by turning the handle of the device. This locks all the directions of the device. This can be repositioned by simply loosening the handle and tightening once again.

# Versions/Customization
There is an optional larger handle that can be 3D printed as well. This version is better for individuals with reduced grip strength and allows more area to grab onto. If you are building this device for a request, ask the user if they want to try out the larger handle. The STL can be found in the "3D Print Files" folder above.

# Build Instructions

Build instructions and design files can be found in the GitHub above. The instructions and guides can be found under "Documentation". The STLs can be found under "3D Print Files". The solid model files (STEP) can be found in "Design Files". Photos of the device can be seen under "Photos".
